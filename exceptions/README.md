## üìÑ Included Files üóÇÔ∏è

| Description | Filename |
|-------------|----------|
| Username and password validation logic using custom exceptions. | `validators.py` |
| Custom exception classes for validating usernames. | `username_exceptions.py` |
| Custom exception classes for validating passwords. | `password_exceptions.py` |
| Demonstrates use of `__iter__`, `__next__`, and handling `StopIteration`. | `iterator_errors.py` |
| Safe file reading using `try-except-finally` blocks. | `file_reading_with_try.py` |
| Example of raising and catching a custom exception (`UnderAge`). | `custom_exception_underage.py` |
| Module initializer for importing the exceptions as a package. | `__init__.py` |

## ‚úÖ How to Use

You can run each file independently for demo purposes.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example: Running the validator

```bash
python validators.py
```

### Expected output will include messages such as:

```python
The username 1 is too short.
The password 2 is too short.
...
Ok
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example: Using UnderAge exception

```bash
python custom_exception_underage.py
```

### Output:

```text
Function Expected positive integer, and instead got 17.
You should send an invite to name
```

```pgsql
Function Expected positive integer, and instead got 17.
You should send an invite to name
```


```csharp
Function Expected positive integer, and instead got 17.
You should send an invite to name
```

üß† Highlights and Learning Points
‚úÖ Modular Design: Each exception is split into logical modules (username, password, etc.)

üîê Strong Validation: Includes pattern matching using re, character checks, and full password policies.

üìö Educational Use: Good examples of exception inheritance, override of __str__, and try-except structures.

‚ôªÔ∏è Reusable Code: You can import these classes into other projects.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Notes
All filenames are lowercase and use underscores (PEP8).

Classes use CamelCase, and exception classes inherit from Python's Exception.

Regex-based character validation for username.

Password validation includes uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character requirements, and length boundaries.

üì¶ Example Folder Usage as a Module
If you want to import this as a module:

python
Copy
Edit
from exceptions.validators import check_input
You may need to include the folder in your PYTHONPATH or use relative imports if integrated in a larger project.

‚úçÔ∏è Suggestions for Further Enhancement
 Add tests/ folder with unittest or pytest tests.

 Support multi-language exception messages (i18n).

 Expand validators.py to support email and phone validation.

 Add logging for invalid input attempts.
