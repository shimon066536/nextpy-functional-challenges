# Generators Exercises ‚Äì Next.py Course

This folder includes a series of Python exercises based on Chapter 4 (Generators) from the [Next.py course on Campus IL](https://campus.gov.il).  
Each script demonstrates a different use of generator expressions or generator functions for functional and performance-oriented coding.

## ‚úÖ How to Run

Each script is executable individually and contains a `main()` function for clarity and testing:

```bash
python prime_number_generator.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Requirements
- Python 3.8+

- Optional:

- `grafanalib` (for dashboard script)

- Windows OS (for `winsound` usage)

## üî¨ Educational Goals
- Understand the benefits of lazy evaluation with `yield`

- Learn how to modularize scripts with `main()` blocks

- Practice real-world use cases for generator expressions
