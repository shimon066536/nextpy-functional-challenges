# Python Challenges from Campus.il

This repository includes Python challenges and solutions from the [Campus.il](https://campus.gov.il/) Next.py course.  
It includes:

- Functional programming challenges (one-liners)
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Error and exception handling
- Generators & Iterators
- Working with files and modules

All solutions are written by me as part of my personal learning journey.
